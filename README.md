[Updated Prizes Left](https://www.palottery.state.pa.us/Scratch-Offs/Print-Scratch-Offs.aspx?gametype=Remaining)

Well Look no further! This project  has taught me a lot while accomplishing something amazing, (in my eyes atleast), it's still a work in progress so please, try not to be too harsh but, anyone is open to improve upon my code and modifying it as they see fit.

This code is by no means refined or finished. It's a work in progress.

Any questions? Or just want to contact me?

### Disclaimer:
####    This code shouldn't be used as a serious attempt to beat the 'State'. It will just hopefully, help you make smarter decisions in regards to which games you do or do not play. Furthermore Pennsylvania Lotto Picker is still in alpha and is more than likely riddled with bugs. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
